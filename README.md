# FaUxber
FaUxber - aka "faux Uber" - is a recreation of an Uber(-esque) application. It was done following a tutorial by Sonny Sangha, [found here](https://youtu.be/AkEnidfZnCU?si=aQV83jk2yTCd7YNP). 

## Description
This is an Uber clone based on Sangha's tutorial, where the user can insert point A and point B locations and get the number of miles between the two points, as well as what the various Uber car ride options would cost based on things like mileage. It functions, essentially, just like Uber, only without the actual payment transactions, and utilizes three main APIs: the Google Directions API, the Google Places API (for autocomplete), and the Distance Matrix API.
